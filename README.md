# Detection-of-Pneumonia-Through-Chest-X-Ray-Image-Using-Deep-Learning
# Details
This project is build by myself in python using deep Learning and CNN concepts. It accepts Chest X-ray image from the user and differentiate wether the patient has Pneumonia OR Not.The backend is made by using tensroflow and keras.

The CNN model has a accuracy of 98%. The data figures are Pneumonia images=3100 and Normal images=6200.

# Flow of the Project
Browse image from the system . Select the image and Test the image .

It works this type of Chest X-rays images.
